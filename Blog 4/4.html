        <h2><a href="#">Certificate: The Monster!</a></h2>
                <p>Let’s start with a common line of our society: <b>Please show your certificates!</b>
</p>
        <p>In a status driven nation like India, Certificate is put at a higher priority than the skills. And this is what has been killing India from inside over the years. Try visiting any Tier 2 or 3 city college to witness this fact!<span class="more"></span></p>

        <p>Taking instances from my personal experience, the director of a Technical Institution had labelled my curiosity with Startup initiatives as a wastage of time & rather stick to the age old curriculum, most of which doesn’t make any sense at the end of the day. </p><p>The irony is, he’s leading an organization, from where the tech minds are going to be involved in engineering efforts in nation building & his pessimistic approaches is a hindrance for next generation. </p>


        <p>The Government of India took the initiative of Startup India in 2016. Now we have more than 20 different state startup policies implemented PAN India, numerous DIPP & DPIIT recognized startups. In the same line, the outdated mentality towards money and business is the most dangerous threat to our country. Because a terrorist can kill few, but an institution could do so for many by killing their dreams!

        <p>The problem is the institutions pick candidates based upon academic merits than over the skills. Every year we get new PhD holders, but most of them are unable to patent their innovation or research. They aren’t involved with creating something fresh. With a trend like that, how can they guide the fresh brains with limitless possibilities! Just Think.</p>


        <p>Recently I completed my course on Entrepreneurship with the subjects like Startup policies, PP process and things around the topic. I received a certificate for that, but completing a bachelor degree certificate is validated in our society than the things that actually matter to the individual! Isn’t so?<span class="more"></p>

        <p>  
From my point of view the perfect time to step up to take risk is in your early 20’s as the responsibilities are few & it’s easy to move on from the failure. But in India, we use that time to learn how to be a daily worker for a company at the age of 23! We are naturally inclined towards becoming a slave! We never try to break the barriers and start something from our own.</p>
       
        <div class="featured-meta">
          
<p>Today many companies and institutions are coming up with certificate programs and we get blindly enrolled in those not to learn new things but to have a collection of certificates and that is the harsh reality of our century!</p>
<br>
<p>We are living in an India that’s producing unicorns and also it’s the same place where building a startup is yet to be seen as a work of high values. The change is happening slowly, but the larger picture is yet to come to the ground! This is the truth of today and that’s why I said the Certificate is actually a Monster!</p>
<br>
<p>This nation needs to walk towards being a wealth driven, where we focus collectively for boosting nation’s economy!</p>
