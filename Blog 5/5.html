        <h2><a href="#">The Perception of being Powerful</a></h2>
                <p><b> Power</b>: It's not just a word, but a phenomena which can hide your crimes, mistakes, failures and the nonsense in your personality. But does the power make you truly powerful or it's just the perception? It's a question mark!</b>
</p>
        <p>I live in a country which is 6 flight hours away from half of the world's population. It's the land of IT and Engineering geniusness and also the land of most experienced and active army in the world but we're denoted as a <b>developing</b> nation and not a super power who is king of exports and imports in Asia. <span class="more"></span></p>

        <p>But in the same world a country with no proper market ecosystem for business, no rules and regulations for independent operations, still fighting for gender rights and a country that <b>ran away from 2 wars</b> which started by themselves are called the super power.

<br> 
<br> 
In this world full of hypocrisy we need to realise our strength and the power to maintain our standard in front of rest of the world. With 1.3 Bn customers we are the biggest market of the world, which holds 50% of the total sales around the globe every year. In true sense we are the real economic superpower who can change destiny of a country in months for ever. A country became super power by selling the iron and armour and we are the biggest market for them. So if we want we can make anyone put down in front of us.

        <p>But yes, we are a peace loving, Socialist, democratic and secular country and we need to appreciate our intellectuals' comments upon secularism where The country who have the minority communities of Jewish and try to protect their citizens from terrorists is human rights violators and the people attacking their own people in the name of Jihad in holy hand of Afghanistan are Great!? .. We are congratulating them. Why? 
<br> <br>

Recently an Indian poet said that India is no more secular but Taliban is doing good and Shariya law will be good for citizens of Afghanistan.. Recently his son is arrested by police and he was complaining that police was not humble to his criminal Son. Sir! I have a request to you: "I appreciate your independent thought.. And we saw how much you love Shariya law and that also secular as per your point of view so why don't you give punishment to your son as per shariya law?" But, No! You won't, because it's not fit to your book of secularism.

        <p>The problem is the institutions pick candidates based upon academic merits than over the skills. Every year we get new PhD holders, but most of them are unable to patent their innovation or research. They aren’t involved with creating something fresh. With a trend like that, how can they guide the fresh brains with limitless possibilities! Just Think.</p>


        <p>Recently I completed my course on Entrepreneurship with the subjects like Startup policies, PP process and things around the topic. I received a certificate for that, but completing a bachelor degree certificate is validated in our society than the things that actually matter to the individual! Isn’t so?<span class="more"></p>

        <p>  
Secularism is not about pleasing a specific community, but it's about equal rights for all despite of religion. India was never secular because a secular country should have one law in entire land which called a Uniform civil court, Should have the same rights means no reservation for any caste or community and eligibility criteria should be hard work and talent. <b>In a country where the iftar party is a symbol of secularism and Kumbh is a communal event, what kind of Secularism is this? </b>

<br> <br>

India is backwards because our thinking is poor, rather then investment upon industrialisation we invest on social welfare schemes, rather then investing on skills we invest of free monthly allowance. We should make our people eligible to purchase products with MRP, but not with Govt Subsidiary price. We need to invest on industries rather then pleasing people during election. We need to develop infrastructure rather then temple or mosque or church, we need to increase tourism rather then organising iftars, we need to question govt & teach them rules if needed. </p>
